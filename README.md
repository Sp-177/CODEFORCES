## About

Codeforces is a renowned platform for competitive programming, offering a plethora of challenging problems to tackle. This repository serves as a curated collection of my solutions to Codeforces problems, implemented in various programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.

## Structure

```
.
├── Contest-Name-1/
│   ├── problem-A/
│   │   ├── solution1.py
│   │   ├── solution2.java
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── problem-B/
│   │   ├── solution1.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── Contest-Name-2/
│   ├── ...
└── ...
```

Each contest is meticulously organized into its own directory named after the contest. Within each contest directory, you'll find directories for each problem, named after the respective problem code. Within each problem directory:

- `solution1.ext`: Comprehensive solutions implemented in various programming languages.
- `README.md`: Detailed explanations of the problem and my approach to solving it.
